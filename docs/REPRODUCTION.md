## 1. How to run

| What | Command | Hardware | Time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tests (paper identities, port vs notebook) | `python3 -m pytest -q tests` | CPU | 5-30 s |
| One single-pass run | `python3 -m experiments.run experiments/configs/repro_1epoch.json --only gws --seeds 1` | CPU (4 cores) | about 10 min |
| All single-pass runs, 5 seeds, plus ablations | `bash experiments/gpu_batch.sh results/gpu` | 1 GPU (22 GB) | about 1-2 h on an L4 |
| Kernel baselines + 50-epoch L=0 | `bash experiments/a100_batch.sh results/a100` | 1 GPU (40 GB) | about 1 h on an A100 |
| Table of results | `python3 -m experiments.summarize results/gpu` | any | seconds |

Data: `--source binary` reads the official CIFAR-10 tarball (the notebook's order). `--source parquet` reads the Hugging Face mirror `uoft-cs/cifar10`. Both hold the same 50,000 training images with the same labels, in a different order (the mirror starts at official image 30,000). The test sets are identical.

Colab: the GPU runs use the official Colab CLI (`google-colab-cli`, `colab new --gpu L4`, `colab upload`, `colab exec`). The jobs start in the background on the VM, so a dropped connection does not stop them.

## 2. The port is exact

`rcdl/` ports the notebook's PyTorch code. `tests/test_layers.py` executes the notebook's own cells and compares outputs and stored tables for all six model kinds (GWS, gauge, RBF, hybrid, parametric softmax, ResNet-MLP with Adam and Muon). In the notebook's own sample order, the port reproduces the notebook's stored learning curve:

| Samples | Notebook test loss / acc | Port test loss / acc |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | 6.6935 / 0.1000 | 6.6935 / 0.1000 |
| 4,000 | 1.7883 / 0.3886 | 1.7883 / 0.3890 |
| 8,000 | 1.5734 / 0.4636 | 1.5734 / 0.4636 |
| 12,000 | 1.4602 / 0.4870 | 1.4603 / 0.4872 |
| 16,000 | 1.4038 / 0.5077 | 1.4039 / 0.5077 |
| 50,000 | 1.1631 / 0.5918 | PENDING |

CPU and GPU runs of the port give the same final accuracy and loss to 4 decimals.

## 3. Mathematical claims checked numerically (`tests/test_identities.py`)

All pass in float64.

| Claim (paper section) | Check |
|---|---|
| A linear layer trained by SGD inside a deep net equals linear attention over its stored inputs and scaled output gradients (Sec. 2, Eq. 1). | Exact to 1e-12. |
| For a positive definite kernel, SGD on the implicit feature-space weight equals appending (k_t = x_t, v_t = -η g_t) (Sec. 3.1, App. A). | Explicit polynomial features, exact. |
| A Gaussian-mixture weight function induces exactly the discrete weighted softmax, for any σ_k, σ_v (Sec. 3.2). | 1-D quadrature, error < 1e-6. |
| Functional gradient descent equals appending one tuple (App. C.3). | The loss slope matches the predicted rate. See the note below. |
| Gauge invariance (Prop. C.2) and locality of the gauge-fixed update (Thm. C.3). | Exact. |
| Momentum and decoupled weight decay have a closed form per stored row (App. D.3). | Equals primal SGD-momentum-decay to 1e-6. |

Note on the functional gradient. With notation q_t (query), s_t (prediction), g_t (loss gradient with respect to the prediction), w_i and k_i (stored weights and keys), σ_k^2 and σ_v^2 (key and value variances of the base Gaussian measure), η (step size), the exact functional-gradient step appends

- key k_new = σ_k^2 q_t,
- weight w_new = η <s_t, g_t> / D_t,
- weighted value ṽ_new = -η σ_v^2 g_t / D_t,

where D_t = Σ_i w_i exp(<k_i, q_t>) is the weighted softmax denominator at q_t. The loss then falls at the rate e^{σ_k^2 ||q_t||^2} (σ_v^2 ||g_t||^2 + <g_t, s_t>^2) / D_t^2 per unit of η. The test confirms this. The experiments do not use this rule. They drop the 1/D_t factor (App. E.3 says so) and replace the fixed ratio σ_v^2 between the value step and the weight step by two free learning rates β and η. So the "principled" rule is one member of the family that the code implements, not the rule that produced the reported numbers.

PENDING.

## 8. Discrepancies between paper, notebooks and article

### 8.1 Method as derived vs method as run

1. **The density factor is dropped.** The functional-gradient step scales the new weight and value by 1/D_t (section 3 above). The experiments drop it (App. E.3, "for numerical stability"). Every row then gets the same step size, wherever the existing rows are dense or sparse.
2. **Two free step sizes replace one.** The derivation fixes the ratio of the value step to the weight step (σ_v^2). The code uses independent β and η. The best single-pass setting has η = 0.003 and β = 3. With η that small, the denominator hardly grows (the 16 initial rows have weight 1/16 each), so the layer is close to an unnormalized exponential-kernel layer. The ablation `gws_eta0` (η = 0) tests this.
3. **An undocumented clip.** The code clips <s_t, ḡ_t> to [-1, 1] before the max(0, ·) clip, with ḡ_t the batch-mean gradient. This equals clipping <s_t, g_t> to [-B, B], with B the batch size. The paper's Algorithm 2 does not mention it (the notebook does). The ablation `gws_noclip` tests it.
4. **Decay and momentum reach only the values.** Paper App. D says weight decay and momentum scale both the stored weights w and the weighted values ṽ. The notebooks scale only ṽ (numerator), not w (denominator). The port reproduces the notebook by default (`decay_scope='values'`) and offers the paper's version (`'values_and_weights'`).
5. **Momentum and decay are combined approximately.** The notebook multiplies the separate decay factor and momentum factor. This equals the paper's closed form (App. D.3) only if one of them is zero. The port has both (`age_rule='notebook' | 'exact'`).

### 8.2 Bugs in the notebooks (active only with momentum or weight decay > 0)

6. **Ages use the current batch size.** The age of each stored row is computed from the size of the current batch. At evaluation the torch notebook uses batch 500 instead of 16, so the momentum and decay factors at test time are wrong (test: `test_momentum_matches_notebook_only_at_train_batch_size`). The JAX notebook evaluates with the training batch size, so it does not have this bug.
7. **Ages wrap around.** Ages are computed modulo the table size. When the table is exactly full (the 1-epoch configurations end in this state), the oldest batch gets momentum age 0 and coefficient 0, so its values are erased (test: `test_notebook_mask_zeroes_oldest_rows_when_table_is_exactly_full`). Both notebooks have it.

The port fixes both by storing the write step of each row.

### 8.3 Inconsistencies in the paper

8. **Teacher depth.** The main text says the teacher has 1 hidden layer. App. E.1.2 says L = 2 residual blocks.
9. **Teacher-student scale.** Table "Nonparametric GWS teacher-student" lists "Epochs 200000" (these are steps). App. E.11 says 200 epochs add 10^7 rows. 200,000 steps × batch 64 = 12.8 × 10^6. The parametric baseline has 10,240,000 = 160,000 × 64 rows.
10. **Learning-rate ranges look swapped.** Teacher-student: β ∈ [0.1, 1], η ∈ [10, 100]. CIFAR: η ∈ [0.3, 3], β ∈ [20, 60].
11. **Initialization.** Algorithm 2 says K_0 ~ N(0, 1/√d I). The text and the code use standard normal rows rescaled by RMSNorm. The hybrid layer's text says D_0 has zero keys and values. The code uses the same random D_0 as GWS.
12. **RBF table.** It calls the readout a "Weighted RBF-kernel layer" (RBF rows have no weight) and lists a momentum sweep that Algorithm 5 does not have.
13. **Scale convention of the 50-epoch grid.** Its ranges (η ∈ [0.3, 3], β ∈ [20, 60]) do not contain the single-pass optimum in the notebook's convention (η = 0.003, β = 3; App. F.2). In the notebook's convention, η = 1 makes a 50-epoch L = 0 model stall at about 45% test accuracy (section 7). The paper does not say whether its grid uses per-sample or batch-mean gradients, or what values it selected.
14. **Hyperparameters were selected on the test set.** The paper says so implicitly (App. E.1: "we select those hyperparameters that maximize/minimize the metric displayed"). The X article says so outright ("chosen by overfitting the test set"). There is no validation split. Section 6 reports held-out-selected numbers for the baselines.

### 8.4 Code quality notes (no effect on results)

15. The torch notebook backpropagates into the input images (`requires_grad_` on the batch) only to keep the graph alive. That costs a full backward pass through the first retrieval layer. The port skips it and gets identical rows (test: `test_skipping_first_layer_input_grad_keeps_updates`).
16. Every forward pass scans the whole pre-allocated table to build the valid-row mask. The port caches the mask.
17. The JAX notebook adds `bias - stop_gradient(bias)` to each RCDL output. That parameter has no effect on the forward pass, but the optimizer still updates it.
18. The hybrid layer runs Adam over the whole pre-allocated table (4.3 GB of parameters at L = 3), not only the active rows. This needs about 18 GB of memory for a model that uses under half of the table.
