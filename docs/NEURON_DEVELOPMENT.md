# Neuron development through training, with exact training-data provenance

Working notes for the follow-up to the RCDL reproduction (docs/REPRODUCTION.md): use the dual form of trained layers
(RCDL Sec. 2) to follow, at the level of single neurons and single groups of training examples, how the neurons of small
image models form. The target is the image-model evidence in N. Cammarata, "Neural Networks Are Already Clean"
(Goodfire, 2026; already-clean.goodfire.com, read in full 2026-10-16).

## 1. What the essay claims about small image models, and what is published

Claims: polysemantic neurons in InceptionV1 came from bad tools (reward-hacked feature visualization), a bad architecture
(no residual stream or LayerNorm) and "recursive generalization" (a neuron grows outward along related branches), not
from superposition; a parameter-matched ConvNeXt has about 99% interpretable last-layer neurons; crushing a layer
(InceptionV1 mixed3b 480 -> 10, ConvNeXt last layer 1,024 -> 13, residual stream 4 and 8 times narrower) makes neurons
coarser, not mixed; SAEs add no new building blocks; an "umbrella = bee" label is learned in 9 steps through the existing
bee route; neurons grow outward over training (InceptionV1 neuron 338: rapeseed fields -> tennis balls, green apples ->
shaggy dogs, broccoli, epochs 0.7 to 12).

Published: no code; the trained checkpoints are named in the microscope metadata but not served (HTTP 403). Public:
the microscopes' metadata and figure data, a training-map manifest (architecture sizes, recipe, probe image ids,
per-checkpoint scores) and the authors' own early-training notes (`assets/early-training/RESULTS.md`), which are more
cautious than the essay: the trajectories "do not yet demonstrate a causal generalist-to-specialist consolidation
mechanism", and the test of an early precursor unit found effects "within the range of matched controls".

Gaps found in reading (details in the conversation log of 2026-10-16):
1. Superposition is redefined as "arbitrary packing of unrelated things"; the Toy Models sense (more features than
   dimensions) is set aside, so "no superposition" is a narrower claim than it reads.
2. The local versus non-local test does not separate the two views in natural data: Toy Models predicts that
   anticorrelated features share a dimension as antipodal pairs, and sibling classes (taxi / ambulance) are both
   anticorrelated (one label per image) and related. Related pairs on two poles fit both views.
3. The mixed3b crush uses dense features (curves, textures), for which Toy Models also predicts coarse, PCA-like codes.
4. Growth is shown on one or two neurons, qualitatively; the essay says a whole-model test "would not be very hard" but
   does not run one.
5. The weak-activation ablation measures top-1 accuracy only.

## 2. Provenance

| Item | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|
| InceptionV1 weights | Google, download.tensorflow.org/models/inception5h.zip (sha256 d13569f6...), the graph Lucid uses | used as the reference |
| PyTorch weights | ProGamerGov/pytorch-old-tensorflow-models inception5h.pth (sha256 44f1f1e0...), loaded by Lucent | **equal bit for bit** to Google's graph, 116 tensors (`rcdl/inception_provenance.py`); the 6 auxiliary training-head layers are not ported |
| PyTorch model | Lucent 0.1.8, vendored in `rcdl/third_party/lucent_inceptionv1` | **upstream differs from Google's graph**: its two local response normalizations use window 9 and bias 1 and pass alpha unscaled, while the graph has radius 5 (window 11), bias 2, alpha 1e-4 and torch divides alpha by the window; every activation after the first LRN then differs from TensorFlow by about 2 times its scale. With the graph's values, all named layers (conv2d0, mixed3a-5b, logits) match TensorFlow running Google's graph to float32 rounding (max relative difference 1.2e-6) |
| Preprocessing | Lucid InceptionV1: RGB, values x * 255 - 117 | as Lucid |

## 3. Method: exact attribution of every update to groups of training examples

`rcdl/attribution.py`. For a linear map z = W h + b (a 1x1 convolution or a channels-last Linear), every update is built
from per-example gradients delta_i h_i^T. SGD with momentum, AdamW given its second moment and Muon given its
Newton-Schulz polynomial are linear in those gradients, so with one optimizer state per group of examples

  W_T = a_T W_0 + sum_k C_T^(k),   a_T = prod_t (1 - lr_t * weight_decay),

where C_T^(k) is the part of W_T written by group k; a neuron's pre-activation on any input h splits the same way.
For Muon, NS(U) = P U / ||U|| with P a polynomial in X X^T built from the total momentum U, so group k's part is
P U^(k) / ||U|| (the iteration runs in fp32 here; torch runs it in bf16). Tests (`tests/test_attribution.py`): the
tracked AdamW and SGD updates equal torch's to 1e-11, Muon follows torch's rule, the parts add up to 1e-12, and with one
group per example plain SGD gives the paper's linear-attention identity. A toy trained with and without the tracker is
bit-identical.

## 4. Experiments

| E1 | Writer atlas: ConvNeXt-SwiGLU tiny and medium, per-class attribution of the gate and value maps of late blocks, dense early checkpoints | instrument | code ready (`rcdl/convnext.py`, `rcdl/attribution.py`); needs a GPU and ImageNet |

## 5. E0 results: the canonical InceptionV1 neurons on all 50,000 validation images

Model and images as in Sec. 2 (exact weights, LRN fixed, Lucid preprocessing, 256 -> 224 center crops). Per image and
channel: spatial maximum and minimum of the pre-ReLU response (`experiments/inception_e0.py collect`). "Top 50" means
the 50 images with the largest maximum (or smallest minimum). Channel numbers are Lucid's concatenation order.
Results: `docs/data/e0/` (JSON). The per-image statistics (`val_stats.npz`, sha256 3b301c01...) and the montages
are in the private Hugging Face dataset `joshhf/rcdl-molab-results`, folder `neuron-dev/e0`.

**4e:55 (the "cat and car" neuron; the essay: a V-shape detector with an O on its negative pole).**
- Top 50 images: cats and foxes (tabby 7, red fox 6, kit fox 5, tiger cat 5, Persian 5, Pomeranian 4), no vehicles.
- Class means (`inception_e0 profile`): the top 9 classes are pointed-faced animals (papillon, Persian, red fox,
  Pomeranian, tabby, tiger cat, Japanese spaniel, Arctic fox, kit fox); then 10 vehicle classes fill ranks 10 to 35 of
  1,000 (beach wagon 10, convertible 14, pickup 18, minivan 20, limousine 21, ambulance 25, sports car 26, cab 31,
  police van 32, minibus 35). The first vehicle image is number 56 of 50,000. Both readings have support: the car
  response is real at the class level, and it is weaker than the response to pointed animal faces.
- Negative pole: broad, round-muzzled dogs (bull mastiff, pug, boxer, French bulldog) and round objects (soccer and golf
  balls, a frog in a hand, a snail shell, a hermit crab, a spider body), with the response centred on the muzzle or the
  round object (heat montage). This fits the essay's "O". Black-and-tan dogs (coonhound, Doberman, Rottweiler, Gordon
  setter) also rank high, so colour pattern is a second candidate.
- In InceptionV1 a ReLU follows every branch convolution, so the negative pole of a channel sends nothing downstream.
  The O is a property of the weights, not a signal that a later layer can read.
- Strongest linearized inputs from mixed4d (expanded weights through the bottlenecks): 4d:493 (foxes, papillon,
  Pomeranian; weight 0.31), 4d:511 (insects), 4d:61, 4d:352 (vehicles; 0.10).

**The car circuit (Zoom In's "superposition" example; the essay: two car neurons and two "generalized pose neurons").**
The essay's figure shows four mixed4d readers of the car neuron 4c:447: 4d:167, 241, 295 and 417.
- 4c:447: top 50 has 28 vehicles (ambulance 11, minibus 7, minivan 7) and no dogs; its negative pole has 39 dogs of 50.
  As above, the negative pole cannot reach mixed4d: on dog images 447 writes exactly 0 into every reader.
- 4d:167 and 4d:417: vehicle neurons (94 and 98 vehicles in their top 100, 3 and 0 dogs). 4c:447 writes 88% and 54% of
  their response on vehicle images; zeroing 447 lowers it by 73% and 60%. This agrees with the essay.
- 4d:241 and 4d:295: mixed (46 vehicles and 52 dogs; 49 and 49). Class means: 295's top classes interleave
  wire-haired terriers with station wagons, minivans and pickups; 241 interleaves vans with shaggy dogs (Bouvier,
  otterhound, Irish water spaniel).

E0b (`experiments/inception_paths.py`) asks what drives the two halves of 241 and 295. mixed4d is piecewise linear in
the mixed4c output x for one image, so the pre-ReLU response at the strongest position splits exactly as

  z = sum_c s_c + r,   s_c = sum_{y,x} x[c,y,x] * dz/dx[c,y,x],

where c runs over the 512 mixed4c channels, (y, x) over positions, s_c is channel c's share and r is the part written
by the biases (0.2% to 0.8% of z here). Check: scaling x by 1.001 changes z by exactly 0.001 * sum_c s_c (float64,
real weights). A shared pose detector would be driven by the same mixed4c channels on its car and its dog images; a
neuron that packs a car feature with a dog feature would be driven by car channels on cars and by dog channels on dogs.

| | 4d:241 | 4d:295 |
|---|---|---|
| cosine of the mean share vectors, vehicle images against dog images | 0.08 | 0.12 |
| the same between two random halves of the vehicle images / of the dog images | 0.999 / 0.987 | 0.997 / 0.993 |
| share of z from 4c:447 on vehicle images / on dog images | 0.76 / 0 | 0.45 / 0 |
| drop of z when 4c:447 is zeroed, vehicle images / dog images | 79% / 0% | 48% / 0% |
| share of the dog z written by the top 10 vehicle channels | 0.14 | 0.29 |
| top inputs on dog images (their own top 50 images) | 4c:460 (50 of 50 dogs: Westie, Norwich, Norfolk, Tibetan terriers), 4c:219 (sighthounds), 4c:506 (Great Pyrenees, kuvasz) | 4c:460 (37%), 4c:452 (poodles, wire-haired fox terriers; 48 of 50 dogs), 4c:66 (terriers) |

So on natural images, 241 and 295 are each driven by a vehicle detector (447) on vehicles and by dog-breed detectors
on dogs, with almost orthogonal input patterns. One mixed4c channel, 4c:41 (20 dogs and 18 vehicles in its top 50:
beach wagon, pickup, Irish and Yorkshire terriers), feeds both halves (11% and 8% of z in 295, 5% and 6% in 241). It is
the only shared input we found, and it carries a small part of z. Heat montages agree: in 295 the vehicle response
sits on wheels and the lower side of side-on cars, and the dog response on the faces of terriers, mostly seen from the
front, so the top images do not share a pose.

Reading. For these two units, the exact input attribution matches what Zoom In described: a car feature merged into
neurons that also detect dogs. It does not match a single detector of a pose shared across cars and dogs.

Limits:
- Only the 100 strongest images per unit are used; a pose code could live in the weaker range.
- Pose was not labelled; the claim about shared pose rests on the montages.
- The essay's guided ("natural path") feature visualization is not published, so its figure cannot be repeated.
- A pose unit could, in principle, be built as an OR of class-specific pose detectors. Then its inputs would differ by
  class, but its car and dog images would still share a pose. The montages of 295 show side-on cars and frontal
  terriers, so that variant is not supported either.
- Open: whether anything downstream (mixed4e) reads the car half of 241 and 295 back out, which Zoom In's account also
  needs.

## 6. E8 results so far (preliminary)

Setup: 8 families of 4 features; related = embedding cosine rho within a family; exclusive families (members never
co-occur), co-occurring families, and exclusion pairs of families; 1 or 2 active features per sample; x -> Linear(64, m)
-> Linear(m, H) + ReLU -> Linear(H, 32) + ReLU; AdamW 3e-3, 6,000 steps, batch 256. A first sweep was invalid (output
bias started at 0, 14 of 32 output ReLUs never turned on); with the bias at 0.1 the loss falls to 3e-4 at m = H = 32.

With 3 seeds per cell (pole threshold 0.3 of the neuron's largest response; null = pole memberships shuffled):
- Related features share a positive pole above chance when capacity is tight (for example 0.39 against 0.21 for
  related, co-occurring pairs at rho 0.6, m 32, H 8).
- Opposite poles of a neuron go above chance to unrelated, anticorrelated pairs (0.67 against 0.48 at rho 0.6, m 8,
  H 32; 0.54 against 0.28 at m 32, H 32) and below chance to related, anticorrelated pairs (0.37 against 0.47; 0.29
  against 0.30).
- Confound: at rho 0 the two anticorrelated pair types already differ in some cells, because of how the exclusion
  structure is built; the effect of relatedness is the change of that difference from rho 0 to rho 0.6.
- Open: 7 more seeds for the key cells (running), the growth order from the attribution logs, and a SwiGLU hidden layer
  (the essay's neuron type).
